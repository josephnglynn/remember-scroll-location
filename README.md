# remember-scroll-location

This is a simple extension which remembers the location of the scroll bar when you leave a url and moves the scroll bar back to where it was before you left when you return.

# Install

Note: some browser don't support loading unpacked extensions. If your browser does not support it, then download the packed extension instead from the release section and load that.

```
git clone https://github.com/josephnglynn/remember-scroll-location.git
```

Then in extension settings of your browser, press load unpacked and choose the repository folder

# Privacy

This extension stores all its data in ```window.localstorage```, so when you clear your browsing history, all data will be cleared up too.
